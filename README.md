# Assignment: Documentation driven development (DDD).

## Objective:
Your task is to create comprehensive documentation for the LeadsCalendar project, a web application that integrates PayPal, Binance Pay, and Google Calendar functionalities. The application allows users to create events on Google Calendar and prompts them to make a payment of 1 USD or its equivalent in cryptocurrency before confirming the event creation.

## Project Overview:
LeadsCalendar is a web application designed to streamline event creation while incorporating payment processing capabilities. By integrating PayPal, Binance Pay, and Google Calendar APIs, users can seamlessly create events and make payments within the application.
## Technical Requirements:
Your documentation should cover the technical aspects of integrating the following APIs:
* Google Calendar API: https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview
* PayPal REST API: https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/
* Binance Pay API: https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-pay/introduction
## Functionality:
* Users can create events on Google Calendar through the LeadsCalendar interface.
* Upon event creation, users are prompted to make a payment of 1 USD or its equivalent in cryptocurrency.
* Events are confirmed only after successful payment processing.
## Documentation Format:
You are required to create a documentation website using either (Jekyll, mdbook, or Hugo) . The documentation should be structured logically and include clear explanations, code samples, and any necessary configurations for integrating the APIs.
## Submission Instructions:
* Create a GitHub repository for your project documentation.
* Deploy the documentation website using GitHub Pages or any other suitable platform.
* Submit the link to your repository on Moodle for evaluation.
## Grading Criteria:
Your assignment will be graded based on the following criteria:
* Completeness of Documentation: How well does the documentation cover all aspects of the LeadsCalendar project, including integration with APIs and functionality explanation?
* Clarity and Organization: Is the documentation well-structured and easy to navigate? Are explanations clear and concise?
* Code Samples and Configurations: Are there relevant code samples provided for API integration? Are configurations clearly explained?
* Presentation and Formatting: Is the documentation visually appealing and user-friendly? searchable? Is there effective use of formatting, images, and diagrams to enhance understanding?
* Accuracy and Validity: Are the technical details provided accurate and up-to-date? Are there any errors or inconsistencies in the documentation? Can users leave feedback?
* Deployment: Has the documentation website been successfully deployed, and is it accessible for evaluation?
Note: You do not need to write code, only documentation.
Good luck with your documentation project!
